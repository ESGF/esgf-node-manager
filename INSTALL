This is a quick note on what to do to set up an installation of an ESG
Data Node.  Here is what you need to do.  

Please make sure that you have read the HOWTO document
(http://rainbow.llnl.gov/dist/esg-node/HOWTO) that provides more
detailed directions, the following is the abridged content.

At the command line:
% sudo -s
% source ~/.bashrc
% esg-update node
% esg-node --install --verify
(answer prompts)

There are defaults (that you should take) for most of the prompted
input. Remember the credentials that you enter in because they will be
needed further along in the installation process.

*************
THE INSTALLATION ORDER IS VERY IMPORTANT!!! The script will not move
on to the next install task unless the preceeding tasks have been completed
successfully. Please remedy any issues which may arise then re-run the
installation script.  Note: The installation script may detect a
partial installation and will prompt you to skip the section.  Do not
skip a section that has not been successfully installed!
*************

The script may be put in the system's boot sequence using chkconfig.
The script also has the standard "start" and "stop" methods used by rc
scripts and may directly be used as one to start and stop the node
(once it has been successfully installed of course :-).

The update script is suitable for putting in a crontab if so desired.
