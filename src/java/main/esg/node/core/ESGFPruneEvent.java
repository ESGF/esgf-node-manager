/**
   <pre>
   Description:

   Specific event to encapsulate the logic for the mechanics behind
   PRUNING.  We wish to have this event traverse the components such
   that it goes to the Connection Manager "CONN_MGR" and does node
   level (node-manager level) pruning of the stubs that are no longer
   viable i.e. pointing to dead or unresponsive node-manager
   endpoints.  Then this node jumps to the Registry and tells the
   registry to rebuild itself but instruct it to do so with port
   "poking" turned on such that the resulting registry does not
   reflect services that are no longer present.

   Ex:
   We detectd that search fails.
   1) If the node is not up at all (no node manager) then we release the stubs to that endpoint
      By doing this we also release the entry in the registry. OK.
   2) If the node is indeed up (node manager running) but the solr service sitting on the port
      is down, we need to keep the stub to that endpoint but we need to purge the registration
      from having this entry present.

   So this event is meant to follow the route CONN_MGR -> REGISTRY, hence why this
   event is a Routable event.
