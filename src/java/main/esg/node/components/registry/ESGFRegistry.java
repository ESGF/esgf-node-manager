    /*Notes on the merge algorithm:

      This algorithm is pretty much 'merge' from merge-sort.  The
      registrations each contain a list of nodes.  These lists are
      first storted by hostname via the nodecomp comparator.  Then
      they are merged.  When nodes are equal i.e. have the same
      hostname, a secondary test is done on time and the most recent
      time wins.  (pretty straight forward).  The additional wrinkle
      to this is as follows.

      If there is something in the "other" list that is not in "my"
      list then I don't just accept it, but I first check to see if it
      is listed in my "removed" list (a list of nodes that I know to
      have disappeared from the system because the connection manager
      signaled this to me in an un-join event that indicated that a
      node is AWOL and can't be accounted for anymore). So, if the
      other registration timestamp is newer than the timestamp of when
      the node was put in "removed" then the "other" node's
      registration is more current than mine and I will incorporate
      that new entry as well as remove it from my "removed" list.
      Further down the process *my* newly updated registration
      information is provided as an update to the connection manager
      wrapped in an event containing the "registry update digest"
      object.  The new updates are then taken by the connection
      manager and added to the peer list that he maintains.

      I am really tring to keep the task of updating the registry (the
      "passive" portion of the gossip) separate from the "active"/push
      portion of the gossip which, in this design, is done by the
      connection manager (soon to be renamed the peer
      manager... soon... one day... any day now...).  THIS object is
      all about maintaining the representation of the network.  This
      is the state that is being syncronized.  The connection manager
      should be all about interacting with peers and peforming pushes
      and getting status on connections and attendance.

      I am depending pretty heavily on wall clock time here.  I should
      probably implement vector clocks here to liberate me from time
      skew issues.  All should be good.  The hope is that nodes don't
      come up in such a way that there are any horrendous time/timing
      issues.
