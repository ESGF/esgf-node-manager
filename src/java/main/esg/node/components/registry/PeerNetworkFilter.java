/**
   Description:

   A utility class for encapsulating the logic for determining network
   affilliation.  The point of this class is to be able to read a peer
   node's network value (at the moment written in the property
   "node.namespace" in the main configuration file) and determine if
   it is a part of the networks this node has been configured to be a
   part of.
   
   Note: Be sure not to put any regex type syntax in the
   node.namespace value.  Perhaps I will scrub the incoming (parsed)
   values as well as I scrub the candidate ones... but for now don't
   put *s and stuff in the value just delimit by ",|:" The * is
   implicit.

    /**
       Overload of isInNetwork(String s) method to provide a bit more encapsulation.

       There is a design trade off... the caller could provide just a
       string and call the base implementation method. However, it
       would be 'nicer' if the caller, who only wants to see if a node
       is or is not in a given peer network to know as little as
       possible as to how that determination is made.  Encapsulating
       that logic keeps things simple for the caller who has a node to
       test. Also if there is a change to the critera for what it
       means to be "in network" then that can be done here and the
       caller won't have to 'worry' about it.  Case in point: we want
       to use another attribute/property to hold the network list.  We
       can do it here in one place and be done, otherwise we would
       have to change all the callers to do so.  Encapuslaton 101 :-).
