   Description: 
   A running list of items of work that need to be done

***************************************************************************

TODO:

overall:
-Put in JUnit testing.
-Install BDM client and simple sanity check call(s)
-Clean up InstallCert Blurting out exception stack trace simply because
 you don't have the key.  (that's the point - you're trying to get it :-)
-Build Shell

esg-node:
-Inspect the "dedup" function to work with install_log as well
xPut in better software version string checking in check_version()
xGIT - put in fix to update an existing git fetching for cdat upgraded versions

core:
Metrics & Monitoring
 ->Put in Query "LIMIT" clause at the end of each query to a configurable value
 ->For Monitoring put in time series results in fixed size LRU cache
-Remove faux 'gateway' from codebase.
-Put in XML Parsing of Payload message data (the catalog)
 -> Have to get or make catalog specific XSD to JAXB on.

libs: (todo's and issues)
-When cut over to ivy make sure to get rid of [jsr173] api jar since the
tansient dependency [stax] api jar is fetched.  Also the [jaxb1-impl.jar]
may be removed since ivy pulls down the transient dependency
[jaxb-impl.jar] that replaces it.

	git rm jsr173 api use fetched stax api
	git rm jaxb1-impl use fetched jaxb-impl

-Roll back log4j from 1.2.15 to 1.2.14 to avoid ivy repo fetch failure
issue.

	git rm log4j-1.2.15.jar use fetched log4j-1.2.14.jar

-Find out from Bob what the deal is/was with hessian to see if I can
safely upgrade to using 3.1.5 - he alluded to hacking the hessian code
on the python side for things to work... will an upgraded hessian
screw things up?

      hessian-3.0.20.jar ->? hessian-3.1.5.jar

-Keep only:
       ivy-2.1.0.jar
       [javamail = mail.jar, smtp.jar] ? working on resoving ivy repo failure
       (everything else we fetch via ivy)

-Find out how to put fetched jars in a separate lib subdirectory
 "fetched" so we can seperate the two types of libs and then have git
 be able to ignore the fetched ones and remove that directory on
 cleanup with ant.
