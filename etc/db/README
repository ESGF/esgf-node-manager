The database that supports the node manager is defined through sql
scripts that are managed under a sql migration scheme.  This migration
scheme is implented in Python via the SQLMigrate module.

The scripts themselves are in:
src/python/esgf/schema_migration/versions/

The make_python script in this directory is called by the ant task
"make_python" and performs the task of building the "egg" python
distribution that gets posted with this distribution.
