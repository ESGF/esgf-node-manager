/**
   Description:

   This is the ant build file for the esgf-node-manager project.  This
   file should not be modified.  A user must set the values of the
   properties used in this file.  The point of this ant script is to
   leverage Ant to make contact to the database and run scripts.

   Ex: How to call this ant script... (snippet from esgf-node-manager install script)
   ${ANT_HOME}/bin/ant -buildfile database-tasks.ant.xml \
      -Dsql.jdbc.base.url=${postgress_protocol}//${postgress_host}:${postgress_port}/ \
      -Dsql.jdbc.database.name=${node_db_name} \
      -Dsql.jdbc.database.user=${postgress_user} \
      -Dsql.jdbc.database.password=${pg_sys_acct_passwd} \
      -Dsql.jdbc.driver.jar=${node_app_home}/WEB-INF/lib/${postgress_jar} make_node_db


   NOTE:
   If you get this error:

   BUILD FAILED
   java.lang.NoSuchMethodError: org.apache.tools.ant.util.FileUtils.getFileUtils()L
   org/apache/tools/ant/util/FileUtils;
    
   It means somewhere in your system and/or classpath is an old ANT clobbering
   the one you want to run. Use the "-noclasspath" flag in the ant command.
